# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The outside probe (#29). The alarms in main.tf watch the box and the
# database; none of them sees a stopped API container, because the 5xx metric
# is the API's own log and a dead container logs nothing (proven on
# 2026-09-20: stopping the container fired nothing, stopping the instance
# fired StatusCheckFailed after 9 min 31 s). Route 53 health checkers call
# /health from several regions every 30 s and want the body to say the API is
# up, not only that something answers on 443; three failures in a row, about
# 90 s, is the alarm.
#
# Health-check metrics are published in us-east-1 only, and a CloudWatch alarm
# can publish only to a topic in its own region, so the alarm and its topic
# live there, with the same subscriber as the regional topic (confirmed by hand
# from the mailbox, like the others). Cost: 0.50 USD a month for an HTTPS check
# with string matching, 0.10 for the alarm.
