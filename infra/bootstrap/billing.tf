# Billing guard rails (TD-4). Account-level, so they belong to the bootstrap
# rather than to an environment: a monthly budget alerting at 80 % and 100 %,
# and the CloudWatch billing alarm as a second, faster signal (the budget
# evaluates daily; the billing metric updates several times a day). Both notify
# one SNS topic whose only subscriber is the billing alias, so
# `aws sns publish` to the topic is the delivery test.
#
# The AWS/Billing metric is published only after "Receive CloudWatch billing
# alerts" is enabled once in Billing preferences (README). Until then the alarm
# sits in INSUFFICIENT_DATA, which is why missing data is treated as fine.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# An alarm's SNS action must be in the alarm's region, and billing alarms exist
# only in us-east-1, so the topic lives there as well.
