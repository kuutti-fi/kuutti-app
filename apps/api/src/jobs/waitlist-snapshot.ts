 * counted per pond, and a pond's figures move when at least k people have
 * come or gone since they were taken (`moveFigures`): a count that followed
 * every day would say what the one person who came that day declared. The
 * public route of the pond slice serves the figures after suppression. It
 * lives here and not in a slice because it reads across several (accounts,
 * profiles, photos, preferences, ponds) and none of them should depend on the
 * others for it (rules/layout.md).
 *
 * Raw parameterised SQL for the same reason as pond/repo.ts: `db` is the
 * Queryable seam the test harness hands a rolled-back transaction through.
 * No statement here takes input from a request.
