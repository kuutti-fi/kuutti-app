Feature: Exposure is budgeted and counted
  Photos of verified people are what a scraper wants (TD-6). Every signed URL
  is a fetch-log row; the day's fetches of a variant are counted against
  matching_config.photo_fetches_per_day in the statement that writes the row,
  and another account's photo is served only from a card the account was
  shown. A refusal is said in plain words and counted; nobody is limited in
  silence. The day is the calendar day in Finland (#52, ADR-008).

  Scenario Outline: The photo fetch budget of a day
    Given matching_config allows <limit> fetches of the <variant> variant per day
    When the account fetches a URL for the variant <limit> times and once more
    Then the first <limit> answer with a URL and the last with 429 photo_budget_exceeded and Retry-After

    Examples:
      | variant | limit |
      | thumb   | 3     |
      | card    | 2     |
      | full    | 1     |

  Scenario: A refused fetch writes no fetch-log row and is counted
    Given the account has used the day's budget for a variant
    When it fetches the variant once more
    Then photo_access has no row for that fetch and the log carries a refusal with the account, the count and the limit

  Scenario: Retry-After runs until midnight in Finland
    Given the account has used the day's budget for a variant
    When it fetches the variant once more
    Then Retry-After is the number of seconds until the next midnight in Helsinki

  Scenario: The count resets at the day boundary
    Given the account used the whole budget of a variant two days ago
    When it fetches the variant today
    Then a URL is issued

  Scenario: The full variant of a photo the account was not shown is refused
    Given an approved photo of another account that this account was never shown
    When this account fetches its full variant
    Then the answer is 404, nothing is written to the fetch log, and the log carries a refusal with the account and the reason

  Scenario: A photo on a card the account was shown is served
    Given an approved photo of another account on a card this account was shown
    When this account fetches its card and full variants
    Then both are issued and written to the fetch log under this account

  Scenario: A photo not yet approved is not served from a shown card
    Given a pending photo of another account on a card this account was shown
    When this account fetches its card variant
    Then the answer is 404

  Scenario: Fetching the photos of the account itself ignores the shown record
    Given a pending photo of the account itself and no shown record
    When the account fetches its full variant
    Then a URL is issued
