Feature: Photo moderation before anyone else sees a photo
  A dating app without pre-publication photo moderation ships pornography
  and other people's faces within a day (TD-8). The automatic check catches
  the obvious; the decision on the rest is a person's; nothing is ever
  rejected or deleted by a machine.

  Scenario Outline: Automatic moderation decision
    Given the check found labels <labels> and faces <faces> at thresholds <label_threshold> and <face_threshold>
    Then the outcome is <outcome> with <flagged> flagged

    Examples:
      | labels                        | faces      | label_threshold | face_threshold | outcome  | flagged                    |
      | none                          | 99         | 60              | 90             | approved | nothing                    |
      | Explicit Nudity 97            | 99         | 60              | 90             | queued   | Explicit Nudity            |
      | Suggestive 45                 | 99         | 60              | 90             | approved | nothing                    |
      | Suggestive 45                 | 99         | 40              | 90             | queued   | Suggestive                 |
      | none                          | none       | 60              | 90             | queued   | no_face                    |
      | none                          | 70         | 60              | 90             | queued   | no_face                    |
      | Violence 80, Explicit Nudity 61 | 99       | 60              | 90             | queued   | Violence, Explicit Nudity  |
      | unchecked                     | none       | 60              | 90             | queued   | not_checked                |

  Scenario: An upload is checked and the photo leaves pending with what the check saw recorded
    Given an account uploads a photo
    When the automatic check answers
    Then the photo is approved or queued and photo_review holds the labels, the faces and what was flagged

  Scenario: A failing check leaves the photo pending and the nightly sweep tries again
    Given the automatic check fails on an upload
    Then the photo stays pending with no review row
    When the nightly sweep runs after ten minutes
    Then the photo is checked from its stored card variant

  Scenario: No label name reaches a log line
    Given the automatic check returns a label
    Then the log carries counts and the outcome, never the label's name

  Scenario: A moderator approves a queued photo
    Given a queued photo
    When a moderator approves it
    Then the photo is approved, the review names the moderator, and an audit row records it

  Scenario: A moderator rejects a queued photo with a reason and the owner is told
    Given a queued photo
    When a moderator rejects it with a reason
    Then the photo is rejected with that reason, the owner's list shows the reason, and an audit row records it

  Scenario: A rejection needs a reason from the list
    When a moderator rejects without a reason, or with a reason outside the list
    Then the request is refused as invalid and nothing changes

  Scenario: The queue shows queued photos oldest first with what the check saw
    Given three photos, two of them queued
    When a moderator lists the queue
    Then the two queued photos come oldest first with their labels, faces and flags, and the total says two

  Scenario: Staff view a card through a signed URL and every view is audited
    Given a queued photo
    When a moderator asks for its card
    Then a signed URL for the card variant is issued and audit_log has a photo.view row naming the moderator

  Scenario: A researcher may not touch the photo queue
    Given a session with the researcher role
    When it lists the queue, views a card or decides
    Then every answer is admin_forbidden and nothing is written

  Scenario: The photo routes for staff refuse a product session and no session
    When a product session or nobody calls the staff photo routes
    Then every answer is 401 and nothing is written

  Scenario: The automatic check never overwrites a person's decision
    Given a photo a moderator has decided
    When the automatic check runs on it again
    Then the decision and the state stay the person's
