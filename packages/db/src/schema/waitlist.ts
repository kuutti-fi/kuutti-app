/**
 * The figures the waitlist counter stands on (#54, ADR-013): one row per pond,
 * written by the nightly job and served, after suppression, by the public
 * `GET /waitlist`. The counts are exact and internal; what may be said in
 * public is decided when they are read (`publishCounts` in packages/schema),
 * so a change of k needs no rewrite. A row is replaced only when its pond has
 * moved by at least k (`moveFigures`), and `day` is the Finnish calendar day
 * that happened. `taken_at` is when the pond was last counted, moved or not:
 * the newest one marks the day that has had its count.
 *
 * One row per pond and no history, on purpose: a series of daily exact counts
 * would say, next to a tombstone's `deleted_at`, which pond and which cell
 * lost one that day, which is what erasure removed (TD-7). Aggregates only:
 * no account, no identity, nothing finer than a day.
