/**
 * The research_id mapping (#50, TD-5, ADR-011): one row while the research
 * consent is active. Written in the transaction that records the consent,
 * deleted in the one that withdraws it and by erasure (rules/db.md); the
 * events keyed by research_id stay and cannot be joined back once the row is
 * gone, which is the point. The id is random, never derived from anything
 * about the person, so a later opt-in is a fresh pseudonym. It appears in no
 * response, the export included (rules/schema.md).
 *
 * The `events` table itself is a partitioned table, which the schema DSL
 * cannot express: it lives in a custom migration (rule 10), cited in ADR-011.
