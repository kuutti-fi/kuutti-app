/**
 * A person's place at the pond gate (#94, ADR-015; TD-10): whether they were
 * let into the pond or wait, and whether matching has opened for them.
 * Written by the count (`jobs/pond-gate.ts`), read by the person's own route.
 *
 * The row holds what the person is told and nothing finer. `pool_said` is
 * the size of their pool in steps, and `place_said` their place in the line
 * in steps ("among the next ten"); the exact figures exist while a count
 * runs and are kept nowhere (ADR-015 §6), so neither the route nor the
 * export has anything to give away about one other person.
 *
 * `admitted_at` and `opened_at` are set once by the count: nobody is let out
 * when the pond drifts and no gate closes again (TD-13). What takes them
 * back is the person's own doing: another pond, or a change of gender or of
 * whom they seek that brings them into a group that waits (ADR-015 §8, §9).
 * The row is then emptied, `counted_at` with it, and the next count decides.
 *
 * The row goes with the account at erasure (TD-7).
