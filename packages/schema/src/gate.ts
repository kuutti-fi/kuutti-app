/**
 * The pond gate as the person is told it (#94, ADR-015; TD-10): where they
 * stand between a finished profile and their first round.
 *
 * - `incomplete`: the profile or onboarding lacks something; nothing is
 *   counted for the person yet.
 * - `pending`: complete, and where they stand is decided by the next count.
 * - `waiting`: in the pond's line; the person is among the next `within`.
 * - `closed`: let into the pond; matching opens when about `needed` more
 *   people who match the person's preferences, and whose preferences the
 *   person matches, are there.
 * - `open`: matching is open.
 *
 * `within` and `needed` are said in steps of `step` people, never exactly
 * (ADR-015 §6): an exact figure would answer what a person asks of it about
 * one other person. One flat object, not a union: the OpenAPI generator
 * turns a union into a type the client cannot narrow (see `WaitlistPond`).
