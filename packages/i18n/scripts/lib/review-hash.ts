 * The mark a native review leaves on a translation (#55, TD-17): a hash of the
 * English source and the reviewed text together, so that a later change to
 * either shows as a text nobody has reviewed. Trimmed and NFC-normalised, so an
 * invisible difference in how the same letters are encoded is not a change.
 * Sixteen hex digits: short enough to read in a diff, long enough that two
 * texts never share one by accident. It is a stale detector, not a signature:
 * it has no secret, anyone can compute a valid hash for any text, and the
 * record that a native speaker approved a text is the approval of the pull
 * request that added the hash (translation-review-guide.md), never the hash.
